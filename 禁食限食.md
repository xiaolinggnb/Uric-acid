Q: What should people with high uric acid abstain from or limit their consumption of?
A:
People with high uric acid should avoid or limit their consumption of foods that are high in purines. Purines are natural substances found in many foods and are broken down into uric acid in the body. High levels of uric acid can lead to gout, a painful form of arthritis ¹. Here are some foods that people with high uric acid should avoid or limit:

- **Organ meats**: liver, kidneys, sweetbreads
- **Seafood**: anchovies, sardines, herring, mussels, scallops, trout, tuna, codfish
- **Meat**: bacon, beef, pork
- **Poultry**: chicken, duck, goose
- **Alcoholic beverages**: beer and liquor ¹²³.

It is also important to drink plenty of fluids to help flush uric acid from your system ¹. If you have high uric acid levels or gout, you should talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian before making any changes to your diet.

I hope this information helps!

Q:Is the amount of purine in seafood high and is there any seafood with low purine amount?
A:
The amount of purine in seafood varies depending on the type and processing. According to Japanese researchers, purine content in fish and seafood common in their diet ranges from 20 to 1,000 milligrams per 100-gram serving ². 

Fish and seafood that are best consumed in moderation include those in the “moderate-purine category,” or those with a purine content from 100 to 200 milligrams per 100-gram serving. Most types of fish fit into this range ¹. 

Here are some examples of seafood with low purine content:

1. **Salmon**: This fish is low in purines and high in omega-3 fatty acids ¹.
2. **Tuna**: This fish is also low in purines and high in protein ¹.
3. **Crab**: This seafood is low in purines and high in protein ¹.
