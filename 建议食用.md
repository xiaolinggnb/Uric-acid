Q:What are the nuts included and are they considered high in fat content
A:
Here is a list of nuts that are low in purine content:

- Almonds
- Cashews
- Chestnuts
- Hazelnuts
- Macadamia nuts
- Peanuts (including peanut butter)
- Pecans
- Pine nuts
- Pistachios

Most nuts are naturally low in purines and can be eaten daily by those on a low purine diet. With the exception of peanuts, most nuts contain less than 40 mg of purines per cup; peanuts contain about 79 mg³. However, it is important to note that nuts are high in fat content. If you are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, you should eat them in moderation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
